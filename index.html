            <h4>Data Annotator </h4>
            <p>I recently passed high school. I also received training on 'Data annotation' from an IT company named
                'Acme AI Ltd' and worked on several live projects there. I am looking for a challenging role in a
                forward-thinking company where I can use my skills and knowledge to make a difference. I am a
                motivated individual who is always looking to learn new things and take on new challenges</p>
